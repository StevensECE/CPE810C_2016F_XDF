The title of the novel has been a challenge for translators for years. It is based on the eight races of entities described in Buddhist text who are more powerful than humans on the cosmic scale. In Buddhism,even though these demi-gods are ranked higher than humanity, they are still bound to the Samsara（轮回） by their own passions and desires. It is said that Jin Yong originally modeled each major character after one of the Races.(eg. Qiao Feng obviously represents the Deva（印度神话中提婆，天神）, due to his fall from grace, much like Indra（因陀罗，主神，司雷雨） in the Indian legends) But as he wrote on, the complexity of the story made it impossible for such a simplistic mapping. Today, the topic of which character corresponds to which Race is still an interesting matter of discussion among fans and readers.\n
