I made the "Initial Sign" with Zizhi Chen. 

I made the file "getfiles.cpp". It can get all the files in the folder given. Actually, it can 

save all the names and paths of those files as strings. And I transform all the image files'

(jpg,png,flif) paths into QString, because of the asking from the image team.

I and Zizhi Chen found and read some data about what epub and html file are. We did a lot of 

communication between text team and image team to make sure what they need we to do and we will 

give them.

I made the " Initial Sign" with Han Xiao.

I made the file "unzip_0.9.cpp", it can uncompresses simple files. However, it can't run correctly, 
I tried to use some code to test this problems, and some of them were dealed with, but some are not,
I will try in this weekend. Actually, I found some informations from the internet that the basic 
library "zlib. h" can't works good enough when try to uncompress the complex files. It's better to 
write own ".h" file, I am not sure about it, I will try again then if it also not work good I will 
try to learn how to write ".h" file.

This week, Han Xiao and I learnt what is epub and html files, and some simple codes of these two.
Cause we should check these codes, then we can get the point how to translate them to the word the
txt and picture teams could use. 

And this week, we get together two times to discussed about out work, each time aoubt 5 hours. 
Other time, we do our own job separately. We also met the members of picture teams, and members 
of txt teams to talk about our projects.
