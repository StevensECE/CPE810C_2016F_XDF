I made the "Initial Sign" with Zizhi Chen. 

I made the file "getfiles.cpp". It can get all the files in the folder given. Actually, it can 

save all the names and paths of those files as strings. And I transform all the image files'

(jpg,png,flif) paths into QString, because of the asking from the image team.

I and Zizhi Chen found and read some data about what epub and html file are. We did a lot of 

communication between text team and image team to make sure what they need we to do and we will 

give them.
